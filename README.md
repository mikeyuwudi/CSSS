# CSSS (Computer Screen Safety System)
A system that utilizes real-time facial recognition to protect the privacy of the personal computer, using Python.

For now it has 3 files: faces.py, cv_train.py, and torch_train.py. I train the facial recognition using 2 different ways: OpenCV and Pytorch.

The code is a little bit messy since it is only for my personal use. Most features are finished but I am still finetuning it to have a better accuracy.

I used this system to recognize human-beings who try to look at my PC screen; although my PC is very safe at my home, this system can be useful in many
scenarios (e.g., when you leave your computer at a public library and go to grab a cup of coffee).

The code cannot be run directly since I do not upload my training images, and I do not fully set up the email configuration (used to send email notice to the owner of the PC) either.
